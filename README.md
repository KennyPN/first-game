# first-game

## Web Server
in order to serve the game up, you need [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm). Install those first.

Now that you have those technologies installed. you can go to the command line and at the root of this folder do
```bash
npm install
```
so you can install the dependencies that are necessary to run the web server.
Once the install is done, at the root of this folder do
```bash
npm start
```
to start the web server. then go to http://localhost:4000 to see the game.
